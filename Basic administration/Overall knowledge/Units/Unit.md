Metric prefixes such as kilo, mega, giga, ... are defined as powers of 10.

However, computer types have long poached these prefixes and used them to refer to powers of 2. In an attempt to restore clarity, the International Electrotechnical Commission has defined a set of numeric prefixes (kibi, mebi, gibi, and so on, **abbreviated** Ki, Mi, and Gi) based explicitly on powers of 2.

>RAM is always denominated in powers of 2, but network bandwidth is always a power of 10. Storage space is usually quoted in power-of-10 units, but block and page sizes are in fact powers of 2.
