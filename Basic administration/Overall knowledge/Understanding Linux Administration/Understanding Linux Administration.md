# Essential duties of System Administrator

These duties need not necessarily be carried out by a single person, and at many sites the work is distributed among the members of a team. However, *at least one person* should understand all the components and ensure that every task is performed correctly.

- ##### Controlling access
	- This is the process of create, remove, handle all the account-related issues.
	- This process typically automated by a configuration management system or centralized directory service.
- ##### Adding hardware
	Configure hardware (as opposed to cloud hosted systems) to be recognized by the OS.
	> Hardware support chores might range from the simple task of adding a network interface card to configuring a specialized external storage array.
- ##### Automating tasks
	Automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks to increases efficiency, reduce errors and improve your ability to respond rapidly to changing requirements. Familiarity with scripting languages and automation tools is a large part of the job.
- ##### Overseeing backups
	Although backups are time-consuming and boring, the frequency of real-world disasters is simply too high to allow the job to be disregarded. Backups must be executed on a regular schedule and restores must be tested periodically to ensure that they are functioning correctly.
- ##### Installing and upgrading software
	- As software patches and security updates are released, they must be tested, reviewed, and incorporated into the local environment without endangering the stability of production systems.
	- **Software delivery** refers to the process of releasing update versions of software to end users.
	- **Continuous delivery** improve this process by automatically releasing software to users at a regular cadence as it is developed.
- ##### Monitoring
	Administrator can prevent bad systems and users outcomes by detecting problems and fixing them before public failures occur.
	> Some monitoring tasks include ensuring that web services respond quickly and correctly, collecting and analyzing log files, and keeping tabs on the availability of server resources such as disk space.
- ##### Troubleshooting
	Diagnosing problems and calling in subject-matter experts as needed. Finding the source of a problem is often more challenging than resolving it.
- ##### Maintaining local documentation
	Administrator's work may not be immediately obvious or intuitive to others. Thorough and accurate documentation is a blessing for team members who would otherwise need to reverse-engineer a system to resolve problems in the middle of the night.
- ##### Vigilantly monitoring security
	*Administrators are the first line of defense for protecting network-attached systems.*
	The administrator must implement a security policy and set up procedures to prevent systems from being breached.
	>This responsibility might include only a few basic checks for unauthorized access, or it might involve an elaborate network of traps and auditing programs, depending on the context.
- ##### Tuning performance
	Administrators can tailor systems for optimal performance in accord with the needs of users, the available infrastructure, and the services the systems provide.
	> When a server is performing poorly, it is the administratorâ€™s job to investigate its operation and identify areas that need improvement.
- ##### Developing site policies
	- For legal and compliance reasons, most sites need policies that govern the acceptable use of computer systems, the management and retention of data, the privacy and security of networks and systems, and other areas of regulatory interest. 
	- System administrators often help organizations develop sensible policies that meet the letter and intent of the law and yet still promote progress and productivity.
- ##### Working with vendors
	It's administrator job to selecting vendors, assisting with contract negotiations, and implementing solutions once the paperwork has been completed.
	
    >[!note]  
    >Most sites rely on third parties to provide a variety of ancillary services and products related to their computing infrastructure. These providers might include software developers, cloud infrastructure providers, hosted software-as-a-service (SaaS) shops, help-desk support staff, consultants, contractors, security experts, and platform or infrastructure vendors.
- ##### Fire fighting
	Helping other people with their various problems.
