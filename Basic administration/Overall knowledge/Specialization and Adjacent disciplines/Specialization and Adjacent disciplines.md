## Devops

DevOps aims to improve the efficiency of building and delivering software, especially at large sites that have many interrelated services and teams. Organizations with a DevOps practice promote integration among engineering teams and may draw little or no distinction between development and operations. 

## Site reliability engineers

Site reliability engineers value uptime and correctness above all else. Monitoring networks, deploying production software, taking pager duty, planning future expansion, and debugging outages all lie within the realm of these availability crusaders. Single points of failure are site reliability engineers’ nemeses.

## Security operations engineers

Security operations engineers focus on the practical, day-to-day side of an information security program. These folks install and operate tools that search for vulnerabilities and monitor for attacks on the network. They also participate in attack simulations to gauge the effectiveness of their prevention and detection techniques.

## Network administrators

Network administrators design, install, configure, and operate networks. Sites that operate data centers are most likely to employ network administrators; that’s because these facilities have a variety of physical switches, routers, firewalls, and other devices that need management

>[!note]
>Cloud platforms also offer a variety of networking options, but these usually don’t require a dedicated administrator because most of the work is handled by the provider.

## Database administrators

Database administrators (sometimes known as *DBAs*) are experts at installing and managing database software. They manage database schemas, perform installations and upgrades, configure clustering, tune settings for optimal performance, and help users formulate efficient queries. 
DBAs are usually wizards with one or more query languages and have experience with both relational and nonrelational (NoSQL) databases.

## Network operations center (NOC) engineers

NOC engineers monitor the real-time health of large sites and track incidents and outages. They troubleshoot tickets from users, perform routine upgrades, and coordinate actions among other teams. They can most often be found watching a wall of monitors that show graphs and measurements.

## Data center technicians

Data center technicians work with hardware. They receive new equipment, track equipment inventory and life cycles, install servers in racks, run cabling, maintain power and air conditioning, and handle the daily operations of a data center. As a system administrator, it’s in your best interest to befriend data center technicians and bribe them with coffee, caffeinated soft drinks, and alcoholic beverages.

## Architects

Systems architects have deep expertise in more than one area. They use their expe rience to design distributed systems. Their job descriptions may include defining security zones and segmentation, eliminating single points of failure, planning for future growth, ensuring connectivity among multiple networks and third parties, and other site-widedecision-makingg.
