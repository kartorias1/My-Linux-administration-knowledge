GRUB supports a command-line interface for editing config file entries on the fly at boot time. To enter command-line mode, type **c** at the GRUB boot screen.

The command line provides you the ability to

- Display system information.
- Perform rudimentary filesystem testing.

>Anything that can be done through **grub.cfg** can also be done through the command line.
