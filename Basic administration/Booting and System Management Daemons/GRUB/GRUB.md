## GRUB: The Grand Unified Boot Loader.

Grub, developed by the GNU Project, is the default bootloader on most Linux distributions. The GRUB lineage has two main branches:
- *GRUB Legacy* - The original GRUB.
- *GRUB 2* - The newer, extra-crispy, current standard.

>FreeBSD has its own bootloader. 
>However, GRUB work perfectly fine on FreeBSD, and would be preferred if you are planning to boot multiple OS on a single computer.
