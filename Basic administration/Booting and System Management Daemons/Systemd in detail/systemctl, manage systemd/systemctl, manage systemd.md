**systemctl** is an all-purpose command for investigating the status of **systemd** and making changes to its configuration.

Running **systemctl** without any arguments invokes the default **list-units** subcommand, which show all loaded and active services, sockets, targets, mounts, and devices. 
> To show only loaded and active devices, use **--type=service**
