Over the last decade, **BIOS** has been supplanted by a more formalized and modern standard, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (**UEFI**). 

>[!info]
>- **BIOS** stands for Basic Input/Output System.
>- **UEFI** is the current revision of an earlier standard, **EFI**.

>[!note]
>Virtualized environments often adopt BIOS as their underlying boot mechanism, so the BIOS world isnâ€™t in danger of extinction just yet.
